# Elixir Implementations

Elixir code to implement algorithms and data structures.

## Installation
[Asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) is used to manage Elixir version.
You will need to configure [asdf-elixir](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir) to make sure the correct Elixir version is used.

1. `asdf install` to get correct Elixir version
1. `mix deps.get` to install deps
1. `mix test.interactive` to run the test suite
